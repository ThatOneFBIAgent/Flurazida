# Privacy Policy for Flurazida

**Last updated:** 29/10/2025 (DD/MM)

---

## 1. Overview
Flurazida is designed to operate without collecting or sharing personal information beyond what’s necessary for its core functions.
We respect user privacy and follow a simple principle: *if we don’t need it, we don’t keep it.*

---

## 2. Data Collected
Flurazida **does not collect** or store:
- Uploaded images
- Messages or content sent in Discord servers
- Personal user information (such as emails, IP addresses, or Discord OAuth data)

The only information stored is limited to:
- **Server configurations** (moderation settings, economy balances, etc.)
- **Backup data**, stored locally or on the Developer’s configured Google Drive account, for the purpose of data recovery or bot continuity.

All data is strictly used for internal bot functionality such as image manipulation, economy management, and moderation tracking.

---

## 3. Data Sharing
Flurazida **does not share** any collected information with third parties.
However, the Google Drive service (operated by [Google LLC](https://policies.google.com/privacy) is used for backup storage. Data uploaded there remains accessible only to the Developer’s Google account and is not publicly shared or distributed.

---

## 4. Data Removal
If you wish to have your server’s data **removed**, you may:
- Remove (kick) the bot from your server, or
- Contact the Developer to request manual deletion.

All associated data (economy, configurations, etc.) will be permanently deleted — **except** for necessary moderation records such as guild blacklists.

---

## 5. Updates to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally. Changes will be reflected here with the updated date, and linked via the ```/info``` command in the bot.

---

## 6. Contact
Questions? Concerns? Want to yell at me?  
Reach out to **Iza Carlos** via GitHub or Discord (_izacarlos).

> TL;DR: I don’t collect your stuff. I don’t want your stuff. The only “stuff” that exists is what the bot needs to run, and it’s stored in my private Google Drive for backup purposes only.
